.SH NAME
T50 - network packet injector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B t50 
[options] [\-\-]
.IR host[/CIDR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Experimental mixed packet injector tool.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI host[/CIDR]
The host address can be informed in one of two formats: IP address or URI name. In both cases the CIDR can be informed following the host name or IP using '/' as separator.
Partial IP addresses can be used. To do so, the user must exclude one or more octects (ex: 192.168 for 192.168.0.0/16 - "192.168." is an invalid host because of the last '.').
When using a partial IP address T50 will calculate CIDR automatically (8, 16 or 24 bits, if the first, second or thrid octect is informed, respectively).

Notice that, sometimes, the host argument is misinterpreted as an option. When this happens, you can use the pseudo option '--' before the host address.
Also, to avoid this you can provide the host address as the first argument.
.TP
.BR \-\-threshold " NUM"
Number of packets to send (default 1000).
.TP
.BR \-\-flood
Superseds the threshold.
.TP
.BR \-B ", " \-\-bogus-csum
Bogus checksum.
.TP
.BR \-\-turbo
Extend performance (create child process).
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-saddr " ADDR"
IP source address (default RANDOM).
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-protocol " protoname"
Select an specific protocol to use (see --list-protocolos, below).
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display full help.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Display t50 version.
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-list-protocols
Lists all available protocols T50 can provide.
.SH EXAMPLES
Send 500 packets to a single target:
.IP
# t50 192.168.0.100 --threshold 500
.PP
Flood test (impliced /24 CIDR. From 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254):
.IP
# t50 192.168.0 --flood
.SH NOTES
Root privilege is mandatory to run t50.
.P
There are lots of options. Please, use -h or --help to see them.
.SH BUGS
As noted before, the host[/CIDR] argument sometimes is misinterpreted as an option.
This bug was introduced when the argument parser were changed to support flexible host "names".
Someday, I'll correct this (Frederico).
